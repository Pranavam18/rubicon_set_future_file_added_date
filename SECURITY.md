# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Email: security@daxdavis.com (placeholder). Include steps to reproduce, impact, and any CVE references.

We prefer responsible disclosure. We’ll acknowledge receipt within 5 business days and keep you updated on status.

## Secrets
