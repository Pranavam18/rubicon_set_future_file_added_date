# Code of Conduct

We’re committed to a welcoming, harassment-free experience for everyone.

- Be respectful and professional.
- Assume good intent; critique ideas, not people.
- No harassment, discrimination, or hateful content.
- Respect maintainers’ scope and decisions.

**Enforcement:** Report issues privately to the maintainers (see `SECURITY.md` for contact). Repeated violations may lead to blocked participation.

This short policy is adapted to keep the project lightweight while aligning with common open-source norms.
